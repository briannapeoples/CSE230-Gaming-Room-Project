The Gaming Room wanted to expand their popular game, Draw It or Lose It, to a web-based platform to reach more players and make it accessible on different devices. Their main goals were to make sure the game worked smoothly on Linux, macOS, Windows, and mobile devices, could handle more users as it grew, and kept user data secure. The design used a model showing how different parts, like game, team, and player, were connected. A singleton design pattern was used to manage the game services, making the system efficient and easy to scale.

The project focused on meeting user needs by turning the client’s goals into clear technical requirements. Object-oriented principles and modular architecture made the system reliable and ready to grow. Creating a design document helped break down the work into smaller pieces and identify challenges early. In the future, focusing even more on security and using techniques like user feedback and prototypes would improve the design process. Considering the user’s needs was key to building software that was easy to use, scalable, and functional across all platforms. I really enjoyed this project and helping The Gaming Room create a successful expansion to their game.
